## Body

During a bull run, Bitcoin dominance typically exhibits cyclical behavior:
	1.	Initial Phase of the Bull Run:
	•	Dominance Rises: Investors first flock to Bitcoin, seeing it as the most stable and recognized cryptocurrency. This often leads to an increase in Bitcoin dominance as capital flows into BTC before trickling down to altcoins.
	•	Historical Range: Dominance can rise above 60% to 65% during this phase.
	2.	Mid to Late Bull Run:
	•	Dominance Declines: Once Bitcoin has had a significant price rally, investors often rotate their profits into altcoins (commonly referred to as the “altseason”).
	•	Historical Low: During past bull runs (e.g., 2017 and 2021), dominance dropped to as low as 35%-40% as altcoins outperformed Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains.
	3.	Altseason and Peak Bull Run:
	•	Dominance Hits Lows: Altcoins, driven by speculative mania and market hype, can significantly reduce Bitcoin dominance.
	•	Potential Range: Bitcoin dominance could drop to 30%-40%, depending on the intensity of the altcoin rally and new market entrants.

Expected Dominance Range During Bull Runs

	•	High Range: ~60%-65% (early bull run as BTC leads the market).
	•	Low Range: ~30%-40% (during altcoin peaks and market euphoria).

Key Indicators to Watch

	•	Altcoin Market Cap Growth: A rapid increase in altcoin market capitalization compared to Bitcoin may indicate a potential dominance drop.
	•	New Trends: The rise of new altcoin sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, meme coins) can dilute Bitcoin’s market share during the peak of a bull run.

Final Insights

If you are holding or trading Bitcoin during a bull run, keep an eye on its dominance as a signal for when altcoins might take the lead or when to rotate investments. Historically, Bitcoin dominance has not fallen below 30%, even during the strongest altcoin seasons.
